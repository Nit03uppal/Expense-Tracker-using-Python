I have developed a simple Expense Tracker System in Python with uses various libraries of python in addition with SQL connectivity for storing the data,to create a basic GUI using various libraries in python.

This interface created gives user the accessibility to insert data into a database using SQL connectivity in python and then eventually use this data to get insight of the expenses recorded so far in the form of beautiful graphical representations which provides user to study the monthly expenses easily.
